<h1><img src="images/me_small.jpg" alt="Brett Morin" />About Me</h1>

<h2>Programmer Analyst</h2>
<p>Over 20 years experience as a web developer, I have recently ventured 
  into ruby/linux from .Net/Windows.</p>
<h2>Family Man</h2>
<p>Happily married to my lovely Minnesotan wife.  I also have a vivacious
  daughter and a young lab/newfie dog to round out my little family.</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>I've long been interested in bike touring and have biked through many
  spots in the northern states and Canada.  With my daughter growing up,
  we are planning more traditional air travel vacations starting with San
  Diego next month.</p>
